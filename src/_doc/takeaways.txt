Context
- define the context #TA01
  - the context will expose values and methods that components can
    access
- define the context provider #TA02
  - React component that is used as a container whose children will 
    have access to the context 
- wrap the App inside the context provider #TA03
  - now every App's child component has access to the context
- access the context using the useContext hook #TA04

Reducer
- define the reducer to maintain the state #TA05
- use the useReducer hook to access the state and the dispatch method #TA06

forwardRef
- this allows the parent to access an element inside a child component 
  imperatively #TA07
- should be avoided unless there are no other choices
- the parent defines a ref that will be set to point to the element 
  inside the child component #TA08
- set the connection between the parent and child #TA09
- the child component uses forwardRef to expose the ref of the element
  it contains #TA07
